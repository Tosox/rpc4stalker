## FAQ
### Which S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games is the program compatible with?
It is compatible with all games *based* on the [Call of Chernobyl](https://www.moddb.com/mods/call-of-chernobyl) mod. Unfortunately, this does not include the three original games. A list of tested games can be found [here](#Compatability).

### Can the mod conflict with other mods?
No, because no files need to be overwritten during the installation.
